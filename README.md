# pixelative

Here I share a set of tools (written in [python](https://python.org)) which I created to produce creative
images. Sometimes the output images are a final result, sometimes I use them as part of a major work.  

## soundscolor

Looking for ways to transform sound information into colors obtaining nice images.  

## interferative

Some tools to blend and combine multiple images in one.  

## attractortive

An implementation of *strange attractors*.
